# credit-default-strategy

Building a predictive model for credit default prediction is a common task in the field of finance. In this example, we'll use Python and scikit-learn to create a basic credit default prediction model using a simplified dataset. Please note that real-world models are much more complex and require extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and tuning.

In this code:

*  We load a simplified dataset with features like age, income, debt, and credit score, as well as a binary target variable where 0 indicates no default, and 1 indicates default.

* We split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y) and further split them into training and testing sets.

* We create a Random Forest Classifier, train it on the training data, and make predictions on the test data.

* Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

Keep in mind that real-world credit default prediction models require more extensive data and may involve more advanced techniques such as feature engineering, model tuning, and handling imbalanced datasets. Additionally, you should use actual credit data and comply with privacy and regulatory considerations when working with financial data.
